        =====
        
        IMS is a simple Django app to for managing inventory.  IMS stands for
        Inventory Management System.  The base models are:
        Site - location where inventory is stored
        ProductInformation - description of inventory types
        InventoryItem - record recording the status of a product at a site
        
        Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "ims" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'ims',
            )
        
        2. Include the ims URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^ims/', include('ims.urls')),
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the ims models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to administer the ims models (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ims/ to work with inventory.
        
        6. To run tests:
           replace the dummy .secret_file.json in the ims_tests package with a file
           containing your Django environment secret information.
           The default file "ims_tests/.secret_file.json" looks like this:
           {
               "IMS_SECRET":"secret_key",
               "IMS_DB":"dbName",
               "IMS_DB_USER":"dbUserName",
               "IMS_DB_PASS":"dbPassword"
           }
        
        7. Be careful with the .secret_file.json, once you have populated it with your
           secret environment variables.  You don't want unauthorized users to be able
           to read them.
        
        8. to run the tests in the ims_tests package dir:
           python run_tests.py
